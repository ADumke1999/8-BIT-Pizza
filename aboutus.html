<main><p>This restaurant was started when an ordinary man went to a pinball
convention. There were plenty of pinball machines and some arcade machines
scattered around. As a gamer, he eventually found an arcade version of a 
game he liked: Mortal Kombat X.</p>
<p>This machine was surrounded by a group of children that were playing. 
When the man and his brother asked for a turn, the children let them and,
they saw the competitive nature of him and his brother.</p>
<p> Even though the man lost the game, he missed the atmosphere of it.
Everyone was chilling and having a good time at the place. There was food,
games, and pinball, and it felt like the perfect combination. Years later,
the same man decided to start the 8-BIT Pizza.</p>
<p>Even though it felt like any old pizza place, this place didn't compete 
with the other pizza places out there. This was just a meetup
for friends to hang out and connect with times of the past, present, and 
future as this place had it all.</p>
<p>This isn't family-owned, but is instead run by anyone with a good and 
friendly attitude towards others and knows how to 
have fun at the workplace. This place has the mission for both workers and 
customers to interact with each other and enjoy the atmosphere. The very
same as the pinball convention.</p>
<ol>
<li>Founded in 2021</li>
<li>A place where both the workers and customers can be happy</li>
<li>Customizable pizzas</li>
<li>Friendly environment and competitive only with a controller or pinball 
machine</li>
</ol>
