<p>Coming from the kitchen is our lead chef Mario. He didn't
have a lot of experience to start. He had just been preparing
food at home hoping to one day make his own pizza. He didn't
want to work for the common restaurants, but when we needed a
chef, he came at the perfect time and showed us the excellent
pizzas he could make. He seemed to be able to make pizza out
of a variety of ingredients, and that's where the build your
own pizza came from! He has been working here since we opened,
and we hope he will be working here for years to come!
