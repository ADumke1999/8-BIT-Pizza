<main>The 8-BIT Pizza was founded in 2025. Its founder,
Andrew Dumke, was born in 1999. The restaurant was 
themed after our founder's love for games. He started
on the Nintendo Gamecube, but he later went back to play
older games as far back as the Nintendo Entertainment
System. Pizza was inspired by the times he and his 
friends would buy pizza while they played whatever games
they felt like. Andrew wanted to capture these moments
and be able to share them with the world. Although it was 
something so small and simple, he had made a lot of 
great memories and would like everyone else to 
experience the same things he did. </main>
